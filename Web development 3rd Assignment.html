    <p>My name is Secampy Taneja and I am pursuing <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> from <em>Algonquin College</em>. I have a friendly personality and enjoy interacting with others. My short-term goal is to graduate in this course and my long-term goal is to establish my own company in this field.</p>
    <p>I am a hardworking and motivated individual who is eager to learn and grow new skills. My weakness is I am not a multitasking person because I tend to perform or do one task at a time so that I can focus on it with <sub>100%</sub> intensity. I am confident that I have the skills and abilities to succeed in this field and grow my business.</p>
